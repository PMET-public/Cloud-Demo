## Getting Support

The fastest support is usually via Magento Slack Org on the #m2-demo-support channel. Use the @here notifier to msg everyone currently in the channel. It includes the PMET support team as well as other solutions consultants who may have experienced similar issues.

##Reporting Issues
1. Check [open issues](https://github.com/PMET-public/Cloud-Demo/issues) here 

1. Always include a clickable url 
	* The PMET team typically has between 50-100 envs that we support/manage. Linking us to yours is the fastest way for us to investigate the issue.

1. Quickly record your issue in video format with a tool like [Monosnap](http://monosnap.com/welcome)
	* Recording your actions are almost always faster than trying to explain in words what the issue is. It's also unambiguous and fully documents the issue in case it can not later be reproduced.

1. (Instead of a video) include a screenshot
	* Some issues are trivial to reproduce, and a simple screenshot is all that is needed. If you feel a screenshot will suffice, include one instead of a video.
